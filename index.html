        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The device posture is the physical position in which a device holds
        which may be derived from sensors in addition to the angle. New types
        of mobile devices are appearing that have some sort of capabilities
        that allow them to change their posture. The most common types of
        devices are the ones that can fold (their screen or around their
        screen), allowing them to physically alter their form factor. The main
        interest in knowing the posture of a device is to enable new user
        experiences with responsive design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the described "folding" devices, there are mainly two different
        physical form factors: devices with a single flexible screen
        (seamless), and devices with two screens (with seam). They can both
        fold around a hinge, and the current specification applies to both
        types. It should be clarified as well that both seamless and (devices)
        with seam can be of different dimension ranging from mobile and tablets
        to laptop sizes. It should also be noted that different devices will
        have different default orientations (portrait or landscape), and that
        the fold might happen in a vertical or horizontal way.
      </p><span class="centered"><img src="images/form-factors.svg" height=
      "150" alt="drawing of different type of foldable devices"></span>
      <p>
        From enhancing the usability of a website by avoiding the area of a
        fold, to enabling innovative use cases for the web, knowing the posture
        of a device can help developers tailor their content to different
        devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content can be consumed and browsed even when the device is not flat,
        in which case the developer might want to provide a different layout
        for it depending on the posture state in which the device is being
        used.

        Reading the posture
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every instance of {{Document}} has an internal slot
        {{Document/[[CurrentPosture]]}}, which should be initialized when the
        {{Document}} is created, otherwise they MUST be initialized the first
        time they are accessed and before their value is read. The <a>user
        agent</a> MUST run the <a>device posture change steps</a> with [=device
        posture change steps/document=] set to the {{Document}} and [=device
        posture change steps/disallowRecursion=] set to true to initialize it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a given {{Document}}, the <a>current posture</a> is derived from
        the current hinge angle and the
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-ORIENTATION#dfn-screen-orientations">screen orientation</a>,
        and potentially other implementation-specific signals.

      <h3>
        <dfn>Posture values table</dfn>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The values are approximations and might differ per device. For
        instance, a device might not yield exactly 180° when laying flat, but
        instead values ranging from 175° to 185°. Device makers SHOULD make
        sure that the physical device postures map correctly to the postures
        defined by this specification. Device makers are also allowed to
        determine the posture using more sensors than just the hinge angle. For
        example, they can also detect if keyboard is docked on the bottom half
        of the screen or not. Another example is to detect whether the
        kickstand is deployed or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some devices might also lack one or more of the postures due to
        physical constraints or device design, in which case the device SHOULD
        make sure that all combinations of angles and device orientation (which
        can be locked by [[SCREEN-ORIENTATION]] and host OS), as well as device
        specific signals, maps into one of the defined postures.

      </h2>
      <p>
        The Device Posture API exposes a <a>posture</a> determined from the
        hinge angle sensor, but additional data can be used to determine the
        posture such as whether the keyboard is attached or not, whether the
        kickstand is deployed or not, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Device Posture exposes high level concept and not sensor values making
        fingerprinting possibilities more limited. Changing posture is a
        physical manipulation done by the user. The frequency of the posture
        changes are low, users do not constantly adjust the angle, and even if
        they do the <a>posture</a> will only be changed in certain scenarios as
        described in [=posture values table=].

        </h4>
        <p>
          If this API can be used simultaneously in different window contexts
          on the same device it may be possible for that code to correlate the
          user across those two contexts, creating unanticipated tracking
          mechanisms. However, because the posture value is typically stable
          for a long time it could only be used to verify that two users are
          not the same, but it would not help to identify a given user given
          the fact that there are multiple types and models of foldable
          devices.

          This API's entropy is comparable to the <a data-xref-type=
          "css-descriptor" data-xref-for="@media">pointer</a> API which tells
          whether the user's primary input is touch-based or not. However, the
          primary input can change on devices where the keyboard can be
          removed/added or the tablet mode is activated/deactivated.

            Posture value readings are explicitly flagged by the Secure

            attackers. Thus all interfaces defined by this specification or
            extension specifications are only available within a secure
            context.

      <h2>
        Accessibility considerations
      </h2>The main focus of the Device Posture API is to improve the user
      experience. There are three ways in which applications that build on the
      API can positively impact accessibility.
      <ol>
        <li>Designing and making applications which do not place content in the
        fold/hinge area, especially buttons. This area is typically hard to
        interact with with fingers because the curvature of the fold makes
        touch less precise or impossible.
        </li>
        <li>Designing and making applications which do not put large,
        contiguous content (such as video or a picture) spanning across the
        fold/hinge area if the device is folded. This area slightly distorts
        content and colors.
        </li>
        <li>Designing and making applications which use the screen estate
        better by providing a split UI (a user interface where the content is
        split up across the screen segments), allowing the application to
        provide a differentiated and more powerful interface.
        </li>
      </ol>When using this API it is important to consider the opportunities
      above with accessibility in mind. Here are few concrete examples:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Placement of UI elements:</strong> A typical placement logic
          for dialogs is to center them horizontally and vertically, but in a
          device folded with a symmetrical fold they may end up in the middle
          of the fold area making it harder to interact with, for instance
          clicking on buttons. It might also make it harder to read text due to
          distortion and light reflection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fullscreen mode:</strong> When resizing an element in
          fullscreen, a typical logic would expand that element to the width
          and the height of the {{Window}}. If the device is folded, the
          element will be laid out across the fold, leading to a subpar user
          experience. An alternative is to display that element either on top
          or below the fold area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving the user experience:</strong> With this API it is
          possible to create a different and adapted user experience when the
          device is folded, allowing for a better user experience and improved
          accessibility. For example, when watching a video and the device is
          folded, the video could be displayed on top of the fold while the
          comments section could be shown below the fold by default. Another
          example would be a video conferencing application showing the video
          feed on top of the fold and the chat below the fold.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content shouldn't be designed for just one
          {{posture}}:</strong> The idea of foldable devices is their
          versatility and the ability for the user to change the posture as
          they see fit. Similarly to the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/orientation.html">orientation</a>,
          it is important to not always choose for the user as they might have
          other needs but allowing them to choose the UI that fits their needs
          better. Ideally it is preferred to make the UI configurable.
        </li>

        Example 1: Posture data
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a simple use case of the <a>posture</a> being printed on the
        console.
      </p>
      <pre class="example js" title="React to poster change">
          navigator.devicePosture.addEventListener("change", () =&gt; {

      <h3>
        Example 2: device-posture
      </h3>
      <p>
        The device is being used for a video call web service. It can be folded
        into the laptop <a>posture</a> to enable a hands-free when placed on a
        surface. The UA detects the posture and the UI is enhanced. Similar
        examples can be drafted for content to adapt to any posture. See the

        Example 3: Feature detection of device-posture media feature
      </h3>
      <p>
        As one of the valid device-posture values will always be true, you can
        use the following snippet to detect whether a user agent supports the
        media feature:
      </p>
      <pre class="example css" title="Feature detect the device-posture">
          @media (device-posture) {
            /*The browser supports device-posture feature*/

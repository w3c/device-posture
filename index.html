        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The device posture is the physical position in which a device holds
        which may be derived from sensors in addition to the angle. New types
        of mobile devices are appearing that have some sort of capabilities
        that allow them to change their posture. The most common types of
        devices are the ones that can fold (their screen or around their
        screen), allowing them to physically alter their form factor. The main
        interest in knowing the posture of a device is to enable new user
        experiences with responsive design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the described "folding" devices, there are mainly two different
        physical form factors: devices with a single flexible screen
        (seamless), and devices with two screens (with seam). They can both
        fold around a hinge, and the current specification applies to both
        types. It should be clarified as well that both seamless and (devices)
        with seam can be of different dimension ranging from mobile and tablets
        to laptop sizes. It should also be noted that different devices will
        have different default orientations (portrait or landscape), and that
        the fold might happen in a vertical or horizontal way.
      </p><span class="centered"><img src="images/form-factors.svg" height=
      "150" alt="drawing of different type of foldable devices"></span>
      <p>
        From enhancing the usability of a website by avoiding the area of a
        fold, to enabling innovative use cases for the web, knowing the posture
        of a device can help developers tailor their content to different
        devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content can be consumed and browsed even when the device is not flat,
        in which case the developer might want to provide a different layout
        for it depending on the posture state in which the device is being
        used.

        Reading the posture
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every instance of {{Document}} has an internal slot
        {{Document/[[CurrentPosture]]}}, which should be initialized when the
        <a>document</a> is created, otherwise they MUST be initialized the
        first time they are accessed and before their value is read. The
        <a>user agent</a> MUST <a>update the device posture information</a> of
        the <a>document</a> to initialize it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a given <a>document</a>, the <a>current posture</a> is derived from
        the current hinge angle and the <a>current screen orientation</a>, and
        potentially other implementation-specific signals.

      </h3>
      <p>
        The values are approximations and might differ per device. For
        instance, a device might not yield exactly 180° when laying flat, but
        instead values ranging from 175° to 185°. Device makers SHOULD make
        sure that the physical device postures map correctly to the postures
        defined by this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some devices might also lack one or more of the postures due to
        physical constraints or device design, in which case the device SHOULD
        make sure that all combinations of angles and device orientation (which
        can be locked by [[SCREEN-ORIENTATION]] and host OS), as well as device
        specific signals, maps into one of the defined postures.

      <h2>
        Security and Privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Device Posture API exposes a <a>posture</a> determined from the
        hinge angle value and other sensors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical sensor readings are sent at a constant frequency to whomever is
        listening to its readings. However the fold angle only communicates its
        value when the hinge is manipulated by the user. Variations in the
        angle’s readings and posture calculation, as well as event dispatching
        frequency offer a possibility of fingerprinting to identify users. User
        agents may reduce this risk by limiting or coalescing events when
        exposing this information to web developers. Users don’t constantly
        adjust the angle, so the fold angle value is changing in bursts: the
        events may be dispatched at a very low frequency most of the time and
        fire at a high frequency when the device is being opened or closed. In
        order for the events to be dispatched, the content must be on the
        foreground and visible to the user. Because the API does not directly
        expose the raw angle values, but a more abstract posture with fewer
        possible states, fingerprinting possibilities are more limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the same code using the API can be used simultaneously in different
        window contexts on the same device it may be possible for that code to
        correlate the user across those two contexts, creating unanticipated
        tracking mechanisms.

          This section gives a high-level presentation of some of the

            Secure Context
          </h4>
          <p>
            Posture value readings are explicitly flagged by the Secure
            Contexts specification as a high-value target for network
            attackers. Thus all interfaces defined by this specification or
            extension specifications are only available within a secure
            context.

          <h4>
            Focused Area
          </h4>
          <p>
            Posture value readings are only available for active documents
            whose origin is the same origin-domain with the currently focused
            area document.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is done in order to mitigate the risk of a skimming attack
            against the browsing context containing an element which has gained
            focus, for example when the user carries out an in-game purchase
            using a third party payment service from within an iframe.

            Posture value change events are only fired for active documents
            whose visibility state is "visible", and polling the value while
            that is not the case, will return a stale value as the value is
            only updated while the visibility state is "visible" or just
            changed to "visible".

      <h3>
        Example 1: Posture data
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a simple use case of the <a>posture</a> being printed on the
        console.
      </p>
      <pre class="example js" title="React to poster change">
          navigator.devicePosture.addEventListener("change", () =&gt; {
            console.log(`The current posture is: ${navigator.devicePosture.type}!`);
          })
      </pre>
      <h3>
        Example 2: device-posture
      </h3>
      <p>
        The device is being used for a video call web service. It can be folded
        into the laptop <a>posture</a> to enable a hands-free when placed on a
        surface. The UA detects the posture and the UI is enhanced. Similar
        examples can be drafted for content to adapt to any posture. See the
        <a href=
        "https://github.com/SamsungInternet/Explainers/blob/master/Foldables/FoldState.md#key-scenarios">

      <h3>
        Example 3: Feature detection of device-posture media feature
      </h3>
      <p>
        As one of the valid device-posture values will always be true, you can
        use the following snippet to detect whether a user agent supports the
        media feature:
      </p>
      <pre class="example css" title="Feature detect the device-posture">
          @media (device-posture) {
            /*The browser supports device-posture feature*/
          }
        </pre>For more information about media features in a boolean context
